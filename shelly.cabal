Name:       shelly

Version:     0.3.1
Synopsis:    shell-like (systems) programming in Haskell

Description: Shelly is a package provides a single module for convenient
             systems programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX
             shells.
             .
               * Shelly is aimed at getting things done rather than
                 being a demonstration of elegance.
             .
               * Shelly maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.
             .
               * Shelly is modern. It uses Text and system-filepath/system-fileio
             .
             These are all in contrast to HSH. Elegance in HSH comes from polymorphic input and output.
             .
             Shelly is a fork of Shellish that features low memory usage, bug fixes, and modernization
